This is a live portfolio representing the work I have completed during coding bootcmap.

These projects include given assignments along with my own original work based on my interests outside the classroom.

The portfolio itself is meant to show my personality and taste along with my professional skills to prospective employers, and will be updatedwith javascript to enable downloading my resume and copying my email address and phone number once I learn the skills required.
